# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a 4-language switcher (English, Greek, Russian, Hebrew) to the site header and enrich media sections with drone cleaning imagery and video content from dronebase.it.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a language switcher component in the top header bar displaying flag icons or language abbreviations for English, Greek, Russian, and Hebrew
- Implement frontend-only translations (placeholder/auto-translated) for all visible site text: navigation, hero, services, about, testimonials, contact, booking form labels, and footer
- Persist the selected language in localStorage and restore it on page reload
- Ensure the switcher is responsive and accessible on desktop and mobile
- Embed at least one video from dronebase.it in the About section or a dedicated "Technology" block on the homepage
- Add drone cleaning images referencing dronebase.it manufacturer content in relevant sections (hero, about, or services)
- Ensure all new media is responsive and visually consistent with the existing dark navy/charcoal and electric yellow/orange theme

**User-visible outcome:** Users can switch between English, Greek, Russian, and Hebrew with all site text updating instantly and the preference remembered across page reloads. The site also features embedded video and imagery of the DJI Matrice 400 performing drone cleaning operations from the dronebase.it manufacturer page.
